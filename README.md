# Burp JCryption Handler
Yes I known, JCryption (http://www.jcryption.org/) is a discontinued project ...
<br>
but I needed it, so why not write a plugin for Burp Suite (https://portswigger.net/burp/)
<br>
using my preferred language, Java (it's a joke, it's a trap) :D

## Building

Refer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) for instructions on how to build it from source.

## Testing

If you want to test it (please skip the Active Scan or I think the domain owner will be unhappy)
<br>
you can use the following URL
<br>
http://www.jcryption.org/#examples
<br>

It's my first Burp Suite plugin, happy hacking ;)
